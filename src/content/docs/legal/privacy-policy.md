## Introduction

PasteShelf ("we", "our", or "the app") is a privacy-first clipboard manager for macOS. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

**Our Core Principle**: Your clipboard data belongs to you. We designed PasteShelf to keep your data local and private by default.
